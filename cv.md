## About me ##
Hello. My goal for 2022 is to increase knowledge in the field of front-end development. Now I'm doing my best to find my place under the "IT sun". I want to further learn the language of backend development and become a full-stack developer. At the moment, I have little experience in versioning and minimal writing of js.
## Skills ##
+ HTML, CSS, SASS, JS
+ Photoshop, Illustrator, Figma
## Code Examples ##
`function squaresNeeded(grains){
  const arr = [0];
  for (let i = 0; i < 63; i++){
  arr.push(Math.pow(2, i))
  }
  for (let i = 0; i < 63; i++){
    if (grains<arr[i]){
      return i-1}
  }
}`
## Education ##
- Belarusian-Russian University / automation engineer
